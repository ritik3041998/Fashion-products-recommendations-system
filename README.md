A Deep Learning based Fashion Recommender System using the ResNET50


Fashion Recommender System
Technologies: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Streamlit, ResNet50, Nearest Neighbors

Description:

Developed an image-based fashion recommender system using a pre-trained ResNet50 model for feature extraction from images of clothing items.
Implemented a content-based recommendation engine that recommends similar fashion items by comparing image features using the Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
Integrated the model into a web application using Streamlit, enabling users to upload an image of a fashion item and receive recommendations for similar items from a pre-computed dataset.
Optimized the model by utilizing Global Max Pooling for dimensionality reduction and normalizing feature vectors to improve the recommendation accuracy.
Ensured efficient file handling and display of recommended images in a user-friendly interface.
Outcome:

Successfully created a functional prototype of a fashion recommender system that provides accurate recommendations based on visual similarity, enhancing user experience in online shopping platforms.
